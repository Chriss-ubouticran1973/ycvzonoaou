Okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Chasing the Wind, and wow. I'm not even sure what to feel right now. It's like... there's so much going on but also how did they manage to cram so much randomness into one  ? Like, make it make sense, right? 😂 The plot twists were like, Wait, seriously? and I'm just here trying to follow along, like, give me a break!

Honestly, I started 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 thinking it'd be a chill experience, ya know? But then it was just this rollercoaster of emotions. One moment I'm like aww, and then next I'm just confused? Like, how do you go from heavy drama to nearly laughing at the absurd acting at points? And can we talk about that lead character, though? What even were they doing half the time? I think their decisions made my eyes roll so far back, I'm surprised I didn't fall over.

Anyway, I remember telling you about wanting to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   'cause I couldn't catch it in theaters. Guess it was a mixed bag? I'm still glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it, though, if only for the WTF moments. Sometimes you just gotta see it for yourself, you know what I mean?

> The soundtrack was kinda fire, though. Not gonna lie, I might look it up on Spotify or whatever. At least the music kept things interesting when the plot didn't. 

Sometimes I just feel like these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 are designed to make you feel like a detective trying to piece together the weirdest puzzle. I swear, some dialogues were hilariously awkward. But in a strange way, it's like listening to that one friend who loves telling pointless stories but somehow makes them entertaining. I guess it kinda works? 

There was this one scene where everything was dark and broody, and then out of nowhere: BAM! A character starts monologuing about, like, the philosophy of kites or something. I mean, who does that? It was both ridiculous and brilliant at the same time 😂 And of course, you can't 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   without rolling your eyes at some cheesy lines.

Then, out of nowhere, I'm hit with this completely unnecessary urge to type console.log('  madness'); I dunno, must be the late-night brain fuzz talking.

So, yeah, I guess that's my brain dump after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Would I recommend it? Maybe, just for the ride and if you're into the what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 vibe. Catch it if you can, but don't expect the world.
